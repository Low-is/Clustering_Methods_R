# Clustering Methods in R
A collection of clustering techniques in R for numerical, categorical, and mixed data. Includes methods for data preprocessing, handling missing values through imputation, and applying various clustering algorithms with practical examples.


Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique where you do not need labels. Instead, it finds natural groupings in the data, that is useful because:
- Clustering reveals hidden structure(s) such as subgroups.
    - Example: In patient data, clustering may reveal subtypes of disease progression or response to treatment.
- Before building predictive models, clustering helps you to explore patterns and generate hypotheses.
    - Example: Cluster patients by lab results and then investigate why certain cluster have better survival outcomes.
- Dimensionality reduction, reduces complex datasets into simpler groups and makes it easier to interpret and visualize large datasets.
